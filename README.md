# United Kingdom Traffic Accidents Analysis (2012-2014)

This repository contains the analysis and modeling of traffic accident data in the United Kingdom from 2012 to 2014. The aim of this project is to explore the dataset, identify key insights, and develop predictive models to improve road safety.

## Project Structure

- **Data Exploration**: Comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution and relationships within the data.
- **Preprocessing**: Steps taken to clean the data, handle missing values, and prepare it for modeling.
- **Modeling**: Implementation of various machine learning models to predict the severity of accidents based on environmental and road-related features.
- **Insights & Decisions**: Key findings from the analysis and the decisions recommended to improve road safety.

## Key Features

- **Accident Severity Analysis**: Understand the distribution of accident severity across different road types and conditions.
- **Environmental Impact**: Analysis of how light and weather conditions affect accident rates.
- **Model Evaluation**: Comparison of machine learning models including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, SVC, and KNeighborsClassifier.

## Models Used

1. **Logistic Regression**: Achieved the highest accuracy and is recommended for further predictions.
2. **Decision Tree Classifier**: Provided interpretable results but slightly lower performance.
3. **SVC**: Moderate performance.
4. **KNeighborsClassifier**: Moderate performance.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the repository**: 
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/UK-Traffic-Accidents-Analysis.git
    ``
2. **Run the notebook**: Explore the Jupyter Notebook `Team_Week#3.ipynb` to see the full analysis and model development process.

## Insights & Recommendations

- Focus on enhancing road safety in urban areas where accidents are more frequent.
- Stricter enforcement of speed limits in high-risk zones.
- Use the logistic regression model to predict and prevent accidents.

## Future Improvements

- Explore additional features or data sources to improve model performance.
- Implement grid search for hyperparameter tuning of the models.
- Consider advanced models like ensemble methods to boost accuracy.
